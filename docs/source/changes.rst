Version 1.0 Alpha 1 (Unreleased)
================================

The first preview release of Booleano. All the essential functionality is
ready: the parser and the operations are completely implemented. Basic 
documentation is available.

This is a feature-incomplete release which is aimed at potential users in order
to get feedback about the shape they think Booleano should take. As a
consequence, the API may change drastically in future releases.
