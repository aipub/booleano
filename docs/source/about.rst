About Booleano

What's in a name?
=================

The author of the library is a Venezuelan guy who enjoys naming projects with
Castilian (aka Spanish) words. As you may have guessed, "booleano" is the
Castilian translation for "boolean".

In case you wonder how would a native speaker pronounce it, it'd be something
like "boo-leh-ah-noh".
